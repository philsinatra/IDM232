## Project Description

Students will create a custom web application. The topic will be _an online cookbook_ featuring a library of recipes.

Students will be provided with a library of pre-written recipes in PDF format, as well as a group of images related to each recipe. Each student will create their own branded web application that will display the recipes and provide a user interface for browsing, searching and filtering through all of the available content.

The application must use the following:

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

Additional techniques, including, but not limited to the following may be used as needed:

- JavaScript
- CSS pre-processors
- Node.js
- Task runners (Grunt, Gulp, NPM etc.)

## Project Requirements

The following outline lists the requirements for successfully completing the final project.

- All projects must be programmed from scratch using PHP/MySQL as the primary programming and data manipulation languages. Use of online content management systems (Wordpress, WIX, Squarespace etc.) is completely prohibited.
- All projects must be self hosted.
- Source code must be tracked throughout the duration of the project using GitHub.
- All data must be stored and served from a MySQL database, running on the live web server.
- Projects must include all of the provided recipes, not a subset.
- All sites must be fully responsive, from a range of small to large (smart phone to desktop monitor).

## Grading Criteria

Your final project represents the culmination of ten weeks. This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
2. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
3. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?
4. Technique
    - Is the project built in an optimized fashion? Will future maintenance be minimal?
    - Is the database well structured and easy to manipulate?
    - Is the application properly templated, with minimal repetition of code?

## Extra Credit

In addition to the front end user interface, develop a content management system for the site, where an admin has the ability to add/edit/remove recipes to the site, all from a web interface.

## Submitting the Assignment

    - A copy of your MySQL database must be included in the repository.
1. A link to your case study web page.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
