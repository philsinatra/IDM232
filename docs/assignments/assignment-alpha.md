# IDM232 Alpha

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Alpha Description

Design and create an HTML based version of your final project pages. The functioning prototype:

- must be responsive (small to large)
- must include wireframe design plans
- must include a design inventory/style tile
- can include PHP based enhancements

You do not have to create every single page for the entire final project. Instead you should be focused on building at least one template for every style of page your final project will need. Examples:

- home screen
- filter results screen
- no results found screen
- single recipe screen
- help screen

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Alpha** - Assignment Submission:

1. A link to your self hosted prototype page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
1. A link to your GitHub repository (i.e. "idm232-abc123") containing the code for your project.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
