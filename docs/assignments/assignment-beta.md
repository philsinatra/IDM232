# IDM232 Beta

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Beta Description

Create a PHP based version of your final project pages. The functioning prototype:

- must be responsive (small to large)
- must PHP as the primary scripting language
- must include data driven from a MySQL database

The goal is to have a complete project that is ready for beta testing. Treat this assignment as if you were turning in your final project, with as much complete as possible. Results of the beta testing will provide an opportunity to clear all remaining bugs prior to final delivery.

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Beta**:

1. A link to your self hosted prototype page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
1. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your project.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
